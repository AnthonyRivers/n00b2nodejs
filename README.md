Learning nodejs - This repository is used to keep track of my learning and progress as I learn to use nodejs on my spare time for fun.

I will store the following in this repositories:
================================================
* Examples of scripts, commands, and simple applications as I learn nodejs.
* Comments, questions on what I don't understand.
* Links to the resources that I'm using to learn nodejs.

I've completed the Node.js Essential Training course from Lynda.com. It cover quite a lot of the core of Node.js. I learned a great amount new things like how to use the "fs" module to access the file system, read and write files, append to files, and use data streams. I learned about the events module and how to use EventEmitter. I also learned about the child_process module and how to spawn and execute child processes. Overall the Node.js Essential Training is a great introduction course.
